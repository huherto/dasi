*Q1: 90.

Q2: 42.56-(1.14x26)+5.26

Q3: All else held constant, the model predicts that later model cars will get an average of 0.72 additional miles per gallon for each year difference in the date of manufacture.

Q4: The 95% confidence interval for the slope of the displacement coefficient can be calculated as −0.04±(1.96∗−16.42).

Q5:

````{r}
SST = 22790 + 57737 + 7003;
SSE = 22790;
1 - SSE/SST;
````

Q6: When dealing with collinearity, a useful strategy is to add more predictors to the model, one at a time, until the bad effects of collinearity disappear from the analysis.

Q7: Constant variability of residual

Q8: The simplest model with the highest predictive power.

Q9: collinearity

Q10: Your final model has a higher adjusted R2 than any of the smaller models you tried.
